Kubernetes: The Final Frontier 

This is an introduction to Kubernetes tutorial. The continuing mission: to explore the strange new worlds of microservices, containerization, and their management. To seek out new skills and new adventures. To boldly go where no one has gone before!

This is a hands on tutorial! I will be giving time during the tutorial to follow along with me and install MiniKube, create a sample deployement, create a docker image, and launch a web application. It might not be possible for you to do all these things in real-time with me (as installation can always take a long time!), but the video will be available and these instructions will walk you through. Thank you and see you in the stars!
